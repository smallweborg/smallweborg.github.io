The small web is a collective term for individuals (like you!) who are building their own space on the web with their own two hands. Also: independent web, indieweb, retroweb.

It's full of wonderful discoveries, beautiful words, and genius inventions, and free of the clutter and algorithmic influence of Big Tech.
