# Contributing

Add a link by creating a new Markdown file under `content/links/`. You can do this manually by copying and pasting the [links archetype file](archetypes/links.md), or if you have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/):

```sh
hugo new links/your-link-page-title.md
```

[Open a pull request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to have your link added to the site!
